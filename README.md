This is the source code for [raych.com](https://raych.github.io) — the digital playground of Rachel Sprague (aka Raych).

You’ll find curated playlists, creative projects, tech-laced experiments, and stories from a home filled with turtles, senior pups, and too many guppies.

Built with ❤️ using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
