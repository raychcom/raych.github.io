Hi, I’m Raych 🏳️‍🌈 — a data wrangler, music consumer, and lifelong creative dabbler.

This site is home base for my digital experiments: weekly music picks, personal projects, and whatever else I’m into at the moment. You’ll find traces of tech, music, and a small zoo of pets (three senior dogs, three turtles, and a couple of planted guppy tanks).

Welcome to The Cove.

If you want to follow along:
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31ekhjd5x5qoyln7zo4zkv4tneay?si=0f0673a420cc4a29) for playlists
- Bluesky for [microblogging](https://bsky.app/profile/raych.com), [photos](https://bsky.app/profile/photos.raych.com), [shorts](https://bsky.app/profile/shorts.raych.com), and [THE TURTLES](https://bsky.app/profile/turtles.raych.com) (and other pets). Yes, I split the accounts. Because I’m neurotic.

Thanks for being here 💚
