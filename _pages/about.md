Hi, I’m Raych 🏳️‍🌈 — a data wrangler, music consumer, and lifelong creative dabbler.

This site is home base for my digital experiments: weekly music picks, personal projects, and whatever else I’m into at the moment. You’ll find traces of tech, music, and a small zoo of pets (three senior dogs, three turtles, and a couple of planted guppy tanks).

Welcome to The Cove.

If you want to follow along:
- I post weekly playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31ekhjd5x5qoyln7zo4zkv4tneay?si=0f0673a420cc4a29)
- Share photos and shorts on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/raych.bsky.social)
- And stream my guppies on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/guppycove)

Thanks for being here 💚
