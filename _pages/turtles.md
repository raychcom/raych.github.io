The turtles racked up 12.6k+ followers and 300k+ likes on TikTok—but I’m working on moving all their content to the AT Protocol. You can now follow them [@turtles.raych.com](https://bsky.app/profile/turtles.raych.com) on your favorite app built on atproto.

I have three red-eared slider turtles, all around 19 years old. I also keep two 20-gallon planted guppy tanks and share my home with a senior squad of dogs (currently three). I create content about life with my little zoo.
