Hi, I’m Rachel Sprague, aka Raych.

I’m a Senior Data Analyst by title, but most of my day-to-day leans heavily into analytics engineering: building scalable data models with dbt and optimizing pipelines.

Lately, I’ve been focused on AI-forward analytics—finding ways to integrate modern tooling and automation into real-world workflows.

I work mostly in SQL and am experienced with tools like dbt, Snowflake, and Git. I care about clean code, useful metrics, and bridging the gap between data and decisions.

This page will grow over time. Expect writeups, side projects, and experiments. In the meantime, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/raychcom) -- this site lives there (built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsprague).
